# Design patterns implemented in Java

This repository contains a design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are essential solutions to recurring
problems encountered during software development. Understanding and implementing these patterns not only enhances code
readability but also promotes maintainability, scalability, and extensibility of
software systems

## Introduction

In software engineering, design patterns are proven solutions to common design problems. They represent best practices
evolved over time by experienced developers. By leveraging design patterns, developers can write more efficient,
maintainable, and scalable code

Design patterns categorized into three main categories:

- **Creational**: focus on object creation mechanisms, dealing with the best way to create objects to
  suit the situation
- **Structural**: deal with the composition of classes or objects
- **Behavioral**: concerned with the interaction and responsibility among objects

## Creational patterns

Creational patterns covered in this repository are:

- **[Factory method](#factory-method)**
- **[Abstract factory](#abstract-factory)**
- **[Builder](#builder)**
- **[Prototype](#prototype)**
- **[Singleton](#singleton)**

## Factory method

Factory method is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows
subclasses to
alter the type of objects that will be created

## Abstract factory

Abstract factory is a design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete
classes

## Builder

Builder is a design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step

## Prototype

Prototype is a design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes

## Singleton

Singleton is a design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access
point to this instance
